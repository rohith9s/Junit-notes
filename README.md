Certainly! Writing parameterized test cases typically involves consolidating multiple unit tests that execute the same code but with different input parameters into a single test that can be run multiple times with different inputs.

Below is a generic example of how to create a parameterized test in Java using JUnit 5. Let's assume you are testing a method that adds two integers. In the non-parameterized version, you might have multiple test methods like so:

```java
@Test
public void testAddition1() {
    assertEquals(2, add(1, 1));
}

@Test
public void testAddition2() {
    assertEquals(3, add(1, 2));
}

@Test
public void testAddition3() {
    assertEquals(4, add(2, 2));
}

// ... more test methods ...
```

In a parameterized test, you would instead have a single test method that is executed multiple times with different parameters:

```java
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource({
    "1, 1, 2",
    "1, 2, 3",
    "2, 2, 4",
    // more parameters...
})
public void testAddition(int a, int b, int expectedSum) {
    assertEquals(expectedSum, add(a, b));
}
```

Here's what you need to do to set up a parameterized test like the one above:

1. **Annotation**: Use `@ParameterizedTest` instead of `@Test`.
2. **Data Source**: Define where the test data comes from. Examples include `@CsvSource`, `@ValueSource`, `@MethodSource`, or `@EnumSource`.
3. **Parameters**: The test method will take as many parameters as there are columns in the test data source.
4. **Assertions**: Write assertions as you would in a normal test, but they will use the method parameters.

Keep in mind that the actual code for your tests will depend on the specifics of the method you are testing. If you can provide more details on what your tests are supposed to check, I could give you a more tailored example.

In JUnit, a data source for a parameterized test is a way to provide the data that will be used by the test. Each data source annotation has a different way of providing this data:

1. **`@CsvSource`**: Allows you to define a list of comma-separated values (CSV) in the annotation itself. Each line corresponds to a different set of parameters for the test.

   Example:
   ```java
   @CsvSource({
       "input1, expected1",
       "input2, expected2",
       "input3, expected3"
   })
   ```

2. **`@ValueSource`**: Provides a simple way to specify an array of literal values that can be used as the source of a parameterized test. It's limited to providing a single argument per test invocation.

   Example:
   ```java
   @ValueSource(strings = {"input1", "input2", "input3"})
   ```

3. **`@MethodSource`**: Refers to a method in the test class that will provide the test data. The method must return a stream of arguments.

   Example:
   ```java
   @MethodSource("provideTestArguments")
   ```

   And the corresponding method in the test class:
   ```java
   static Stream<Arguments> provideTestArguments() {
       return Stream.of(
           Arguments.of("input1", "expected1"),
           Arguments.of("input2", "expected2"),
           Arguments.of("input3", "expected3")
       );
   }
   ```

4. **`@EnumSource`**: Used when you want to run a test with different values from an enumeration. It can provide all or a subset of the enum constants.

   Example:
   ```java
   @EnumSource(MyEnum.class)
   ```

Each of these annotations is used to specify the input data for each iteration of a parameterized test. The test framework will then invoke the test method once for each set of data provided by the data source.
